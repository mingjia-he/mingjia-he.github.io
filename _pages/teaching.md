**Course:** _Planning and Decision-Making for Autonomous Robots_  
**Role:** Teaching Assistant  
**Institution:** ETH Zurich

**Course Description:**  
Planning safe and efficient motions for robots in complex environments, often shared with humans and other robots, is a challenging problem that combines discrete and continuous mathematics, as well as probabilistic, game-theoretic, and learning aspects. 

This course covers the algorithmic foundations of motion planning, with an eye toward real-world implementation issues.
