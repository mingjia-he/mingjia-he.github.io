I'm a doctoral student in [Professor Frazzoli's group](https://idsc.ethz.ch/research-frazzoli.html) at the Institute of Dynamic Systems and Control (IDSC), ETH Zurich. 
My research explores **strategic interactions** in multi-agent autonomous systems, with the goal of developing control strategies and cooperative mechanisms that redefine what is possible in future mobility. 

I am passionate about leveraging advances in **game theory** and **optimization techniques** to build more intelligent, efficient, and resilient mobility systems. The applications of my work span diverse mobility systems, including railway systems, urban multi-modal transit networks, and autonomous on-demand mobility services.
