Transport networks in neighboring regions are deeply interconnected—interregional trips rely on multiple transport systems rather than a single network. As mobility challenges grow more complex, cooperation between regions becomes essential for effective planning.

This project explores **how cooperative strategies can enhance regional transport planning**, using **interactive storytelling techniques** to clearly communicate insights to decision-makers and the public.

### What We Are Building

We are developing an **interactive storytelling map** designed to:

- Present the background and challenges of cooperative transport planning
- Visualize different transportation network configurations
- Show how cooperation impacts environmental sustainability, transport profitability, and social welfare.
- Illustrate effects on both **transport operators** and **passengers** through narrative-driven, intuitive visualizations

The final product will be a **user-friendly, web-based application** that combines data, design, and storytelling to support evidence-based decision-making.
