In this project, we investigate the foundations of autonomy-enabling infrastructure and its impact on future mobility systems built around Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD). The work combines first-principles reasoning, modeling and analytical methods, control strategies, and simulation tools to support the coordinated operation of autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets.

### Tasks
1. **Assess autonomy outsourcing:** Explore the potential for offloading parts of the AV autonomy stack to public infrastructure, including a detailed analysis of costs, benefits, scalability, and system-level trade-offs.  
2. **Enhance simulation frameworks:** Extend state-of-the-art AMoD and mobility simulation platforms to evaluate the effects of specific infrastructural interventions.  
3. **Develop case studies:** Design and analyze case studies for both Swiss and international contexts, covering urban and rural environments.
